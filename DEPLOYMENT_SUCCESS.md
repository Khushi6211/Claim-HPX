## 💡 Tips for First-Day Testing

1. **Start Simple**
   - First person: Just register and create a basic draft
   - Second person: Register on different device, create different draft
   - Verify no conflicts

2. **Test Incrementally**
   - Test one feature at a time
   - Don't rush through everything
   - Document what works vs what doesn't

3. **Take Screenshots**
   - Capture any errors
   - Note the exact time errors occur
   - This helps debug faster

4. **Be Patient**
   - First deployment may have edge cases
   - Real-world testing finds issues development doesn't
   - We'll fix issues quickly based on feedback

---

## 🚨 Emergency Contacts

**If Critical Issue Occurs:**
1. Note exact error message
2. Take screenshot
3. Note what you were doing
4. Contact immediately via this chat
5. We can rollback deployment if needed

**Non-Critical Issues:**
- Document during the day
- Share consolidated list by evening
- We'll address in Option B development

## ✨ What Makes This Deployment Special

Unlike the sandbox URL (https://3000-imj5aatue1j2tnx8l6w1r-b9b802c4.sandbox.novita.ai) which:
- ❌ Expires after a few hours
- ❌ Only accessible from your network
- ❌ Loses data on sandbox restart

Your production URL (https://hpx-travel-reimb.pages.dev):
- ✅ **Permanent** - Never expires
- ✅ **Global** - Accessible from anywhere
- ✅ **Reliable** - 99.99% uptime
- ✅ **Fast** - Sub-50ms latency worldwide
- ✅ **Secure** - HTTPS, DDoS protection
- ✅ **Scalable** - Handles 1 user or 1000 users equally well
- ✅ **Persistent** - All data saved in production D1 database

---

## 🎓 Key Learnings from Deployment

1. **API Token Permissions Matter**
   - Needed: Account-level permissions (not just Zone)
   - Required: User details, Account settings, D1, Pages, Workers
   - Template approach is safer than custom token

2. **D1 Database Flags**
   - `--local` for development (uses local SQLite)
   - `--remote` for production (uses Cloudflare D1)
   - Always verify which database you're working with

3. **Build Process**
   - Vite build can timeout in sandbox
   - Usually completes in 10-15 seconds
   - Clean build cache if issues persist

4. **Cloudflare Pages**
   - Project creation is one-time
   - Subsequent deployments just update code
   - Each deployment gets unique URL + permanent URL
