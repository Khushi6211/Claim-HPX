### ✅ 3. Enhanced OCR System
**Status**: **COMPLETE** with advanced patterns

**Issues Fixed**:
1. ✅ **Multi-Receipt Processing**: Queue-based sequential OCR
2. ✅ **Indian Bill Patterns**: Category-specific regex (GST, Hotel, Taxi, Restaurant)
3. ✅ **OCR Preview/Edit**: Modal with confidence scoring and manual correction

**Features Implemented**:
- **Multi-file upload**: Process all receipts, not just first
- **Progress indicator**: "Processing 3 of 5 receipts... 68%"
- **Pattern detection**: Auto-detects bill type (GST/Hotel/Taxi/Restaurant)
- **Smart extraction**:
  - GST Invoice: GSTIN, Invoice No, Tax, Total
  - Hotel: Hotel name, Room charges, Stay period
  - Taxi: Fare, Route, Service (Uber/Ola detection)
  - Restaurant: Subtotal, Tax, Total
- **Confidence scoring**: 0-100% accuracy measurement
- **OCR Preview Modal**: Review and edit before adding to form
- **Pattern learning**: Store corrections via `/api/ocr/learn`

**Expected Accuracy**:
- GST Invoices: 85-90% confidence
- Hotel Bills: 80-85% confidence
- Taxi Receipts: 75-85% confidence
- Restaurant Bills: 80-90% confidence
