**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: ‚úÖ ALL THREE ISSUES RESOLVED

---

## üêõ Issues Reported by Ashish

### Issue #1: OCR Upload Error ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: "Failed to process invoice-1315406828.webp: Tesseract is not defined"

**Root Cause**: Tesseract.js CDN library was not included in the HTML

**Fix Applied**:
- Added Tesseract.js CDN to HTML head section
- Location: `src/index.tsx` line 917

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tesseract.js@5/dist/tesseract.min.js"></script>
```

**Expected Behavior Now**:
- Upload receipt images ‚Üí OCR processes successfully
- Shows progress: "Processing 1 of 3... 68%"
- Preview modal appears with extracted data
- Can edit and add to form

---

### Issue #2: Wrong Password Error Message ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: When entering wrong password, shows "Session expired. Please login again." instead of "Invalid password"

**Root Cause**: The API helper function (`apiCall`) was treating ALL 401 errors as session expiration, including wrong password during login

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `apiCall` function to skip logout during login/register attempts
- Location: `public/static/app-new.js` line 37

```javascript
// Before (WRONG):
if (response.status === 401) {
  logout()  // This was wrong - always logged out
  throw new Error('Session expired. Please login again.')
}

// After (CORRECT):
if (response.status === 401 && !endpoint.includes('/auth/login') && !endpoint.includes('/auth/register')) {
  logout()  // Only logout if NOT during login/register
  throw new Error('Session expired. Please login again.')
}
```

**Expected Behavior Now**:
- Wrong password ‚Üí Shows: "Invalid employee code or password"
- Correct password ‚Üí Logs in successfully
- Session expires later ‚Üí Shows: "Session expired. Please login again."

### Issue #3: Template Feature Missing ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Template functionality (Save as Template, My Templates buttons) was not present in the new version

**Root Cause**: During the rewrite to add authentication and cloud sync, the template feature was not migrated from the original version

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **Added Template Buttons** (Quick Actions Bar):
   - "Save as Template" button (purple)
   - "My Templates" button (indigo)

2. **Added Templates Modal** (UI):
   - Modal with list of saved templates
   - Load and Delete actions for each template
   - Shows template name, creation date, purpose

3. **Added Template Functions** (JavaScript):
   - `saveAsTemplate()` - Save current form as reusable template
   - `loadTemplate(index)` - Load template into form
   - `deleteTemplate(index)` - Delete template with confirmation
   - `showTemplatesModal()` - Show templates list
   - `updateTemplatesList()` - Refresh template display

**Storage**: Templates use localStorage (browser-based, not cloud-synced)

**Expected Behavior Now**:
1. Fill form with common trip pattern
2. Click "Save as Template"
3. Enter template name (e.g., "Delhi-Mumbai Trip")
4. Template saved to localStorage
5. Click "My Templates" to see all saved templates
6. Click "Load" to populate form with template data
7. Click "Delete" to remove template
